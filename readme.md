This script helps you to log into Overwatch automatically so you can have a toilet break before climbing the SR mountain.

To use this script, please have python 3 installed in your computer. Also, the script has not been tested with other screen resolutions, other than 1920 x 1080, so if you're using another resolution, let me know if the script does not work.

Tip: you can download the latest version of python 3 for your operating system here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Before running OWstarter.py for the first time, please do the following:
1) Key your password into password.txt (found in Config folder)
2) Ensure that the path to Overwatch Launcher.exe is correct in launcher.txt (found in Config folder as well)
3) Run update_deps.bat to ensure you have all the dependencies required to run the script
4) Ensure that your login email is already shown in the launcher by default.
